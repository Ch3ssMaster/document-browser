### üôã About The Technologies Used
This project includes the most up-to-date features from React.js (Hooks) and Redux (async thunks).

## üöÄ  Run The Project Locally
To start with, you can clone this repo pasting the following command in a shell:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ch3ssMaster/document-browser.git
```
To continue, I recommend you to `maintain the original file package-lock.json` and install the node packages with the following command:
```sh
npm ci
```
Once the installation has finished, `you should run both json-server and react simultaneosly`. I added a script to easily launch them. Run the following command: 
```sh
npm run dev
```
It will start a json-server in [http://localhost:8000/documents](http://localhost:8000/documents). The document browser will run in the URL: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).

### üí° Using The Document Browser
To add new documents, write a name for the document in the input field and press the `"+Add new"` button. The rest of the fields will be randomly generated.

You can check the new document ordering the results table by pressing the select `"Date"` button and choosing `"descend"`. 
As you can imagine, simply pressing the `"trash"` icon will delete the corresponding document in the same row.
Also is possible to `"filter"` the showed documents by status, checking the boxes in the left side menu.
